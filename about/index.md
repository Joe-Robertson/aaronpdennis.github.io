I'm a student at Penn State studying cartography and geography.


I have always had an enthusiasm for exploration, spatial thinking, maps, and looking at the larger context of an issue or pattern. Growing up, I found myself studying maps of my county for new biking routes, exploring a local creek in my kayak, or taking a geometric approach to calculus problems.  After arriving at Penn State I quickly found a home in geography.


As a geographer, I am able to think critically about issues or patterns that occur over space without limiting myself to a single discipline and I am able to arrive at conclusions through a careful gathering of information, analysis of data, and the application of my own knowledge of societal, economic, and environmental issues.

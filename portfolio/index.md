# Cartography

## Grayscale Maps of Study Regions

Working with researchers in the geography department here at Penn State, I created these maps of various study regions.


## Predicting Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Spread

These maps were created to illustrate the spread of hemlock woolly adelgid in the Eastern United States.


## Presenting Field Work at Conference

This poster is based off of field work done in rural Tanzania as part of my study abroad trip in the summer of 2013 with Penn State Landscape Architecture faculty Brian Orland and Larry Gorenflo. I created the map before I had any formal training in cartography or GIS -- I was given a laptop, some data, and imagery -- and there is plenty I would change now if I still had access to the data or even a PDF version of the map. Unfortunately, I made a few mistakes, but still had an absolute blast making this map and am pleased with the design of the poster as a whole. I presented this poster as part of a poster session at the 2014 AAG Annual Meeting in Tampa, Florida.

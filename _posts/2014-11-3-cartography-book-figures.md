I've been working with Cindy Brewer in the Gould Center at Penn State to help rewrite her book, <ul>Designing Better Maps</ul>, published by Esri Press. These are some of the figures I've created to explain color decisions for maps and bivariate symbols. Figures copyright Esri Press. These are not final draft figures.

This figure demonstrates a diverging color scheme.

The new book includes a new section on bivariate choropleth mapping. Cindy has worked extensively with <a href="www.colorbrewer2.org">color schemes for maps</a>. Bivariate maps, however, require different considerations and we're still trying to figure it out.

We tried to pull a variety data sources for the book. This one won't be in the final draft, but it's an interesting look at rooftops in Honolulu.

This figure demonstrates a sequential color scheme.

A fun look at the potential for bivariate symbols using NHD Plus data.

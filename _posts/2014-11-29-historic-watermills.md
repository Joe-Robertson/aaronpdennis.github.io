The stream network of the Mid-Atlantic region saw the creation of thousands of watermills from the period of initial European settlement to as late as the early 20th century. These mills were used most commonly for grinding grain, as well as other mechanical processes such as sawing timber into lumber, hammering at iron forges, or manufacturing goods including paper and cotton. A watermill relied on a milldam and millrace to provide the hydrologic potential energy to turn a waterwheel. Processing ore, grain, or timber at the mill automated the otherwise difficult process of manually grinding or sawing and it allowed for the easier transport of goods to market. The prevalence and utility of watermills from the 1600’s to the early 1900’s suggests their importance to historic communities. The intent of this paper is to determine how the location and qualities of these watermills reflected and changed the region’s rural landscape and explore the lasting impact of these mills on our modern landscape.

### The Data

Inspiration for this work is derived from a dataset collected by the Historic Sediment and Geomorphology Research Group at Franklin & Marshall College. In this dataset, milldam locations from historical atlases for eight counties in Pennsylvania and Maryland were carefully digitized, and information on year surveyed, watermill type, and watermill name, if available, was recorded.

</figure>

These atlases were more accurate in urban areas and along major roads, as well as along waterways, which provided a significant landmark. Watermills were sometimes represented on these maps as a pond, a dam, a millrace, or simply a label. Nearly all of the mills from this time period have disappeared or out of operation.

</figure>

A watermill in the mid-19th century consisted of a dam and pond to create hydrologic potential energy, a sluice to carry the water to the watermill, a waterwheel to turn and power the mill, and a tailrace to carry the water back into the stream or river. Building or operating a mill would have required some expertise, a suitable plot of land, and enough capital to invest in the necessary parts. Mills varied from industrial operations in large cities to small handcrafted structures in the backwoods.

	<figcaption>The watermill and dam related facilities in this dataset can be classified into six groups, with some dam locations falling into multiple groups.</figcaption>
</figure>

The data collected by the Franklin and Marshall research group shows over 2,00 milldam locations for eleven historical atlases with dozens of unique mill types. To analyze and visualize this data, each watermill and milldam data point was assigned membership to one or, in the case of multi-industry mills, multiple categories. These categories are as follows:
  

Agriculture (represented in green)

- Grist mills
- Flour mills
- Clover mills
- Bone mills
- Cider mills
- Chopping mills
- Distilleries

  

Timber (represented in orange)

- Saw mill
- Shingle mill
- Bark mill
- Lathes

  

Factory (represented in purple)

- Factory mill
- Plaster mill
- Cotton mill
- Woolen mill
- Powder mill
- Paper mill
- Dye works
- Machine mill
- Tannery
- Merchant mill
- Fulling mill
- Carding mill

  

Mining (represented in pink)

- Furnace
- Foundry
- Forge
- Iron works
- Tilt mill
- Oil works
- Ore wash
- Rolling mill
- Tile mill

  

Water transport or storage (represented in blue)

- Splash dam
- Canal
- Pond
- Reservoir

  

Unknown (represented in grey)

- Mill

Placing these mills on a map, comparing them to modern hydrology, and searching for stories of these historic locations begins to provide and understanding of the mid-19th century watermill. This data and the histories behind it can help answer questions about what role watermills played in local landscapes, who shaped the milling industry, how did place effect the potential for certain types of milling operations, and how the milling industry varied across space.

### Baltimore County and Baltimore City, 1857 and 1863

Baltimore was particularly well suited to milling operations (Chidester, 2009). Once focused on flour milling, textiles became one of Maryland’s most important industries by the mid 19th century. In Baltimore, Jones Falls, Gwynn Falls, Gunpowder Falls, and the Patapsco River were important sources of waterpower. Specific products of Baltimore’s textile industries included the cloth sails for the clipper ships in Baltimore’s harbor. Textiles made Maryland the largest manufacturing state in the south and contributed to a fast growing economy.

</figure>

Whereas in other regions milling operations were sometimes carried out by individuals or small families who had some success in farming or previous experience as millers, Baltimore milling was characterized by large estates or companies owning and overseeing multiple milling operations. Instead of small facilities transferring from one landholding individual to another, Baltimore’s factory mills were large-scale industrial projects sensitive to market influences and were transferred between large companies that usually had stake in multiple operations.

	<figcaption>The Avalon Iron Works, originally Dorsey's Forge, was at one point purchased by the Ellicott family.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Ellicott family was an example of an estate with large industrial holdings. This family rose to prominence with early success in Maryland’s merchant flour industry (Sharp, 1998). Success in the flour industry allowed the Ellicott’s to move into industrial operations such as nail manufacture and metalworking. Financial panic in 1837 led to the Ellicott’s losing much of their holdings, including their rolling mill facility, which was acquired by a group of investors. Metal works such as the rolling mill facility were transitioned into textile facilities and other industrial operations in the later 19th century as Baltimore’s industries diversified.

	<figcaption>At one point between 1770 and 1850, the Owings Family ran at least six mills in their area surrounding their home.</figcaption>
</figure>

A look at other mills from Baltimore’s historic atlases reveals milling operations with labels such as “Maryland Machine Manufactory Company” and “F.W. Hook & Co. Cotton & Yarn Fact.” revealing the industrial nature of the operations. Other milling operations were large scale, but run by a single family. Samuel Owings II built his first mill in 1770, and his family would continue milling operations until approximately 1850. The Owings property included a main house, a tenant house, and a two-story slave house (McGrain, 1987).

### Montgomery County, 1865 and 1879

In the mid-19th Century, Montgomery County was characterized primarily by grist and saw mills serving the agricultural industries of the county. There were slightly fewer mills included in the 1879 historical atlas than the 1865 atlas, perhaps due to events related to the Civil War or an increase in steam powered mills.

</figure>

The general pattern of milldam locations in Montgomery County shows grist and saw mills located along the headwaters of streams and a few factory operations on the larger rivers, closer to Washington, D.C. Agricultural activity in Montgomery would have provided for people living in Washington and some of the paper mills in the county are recorded as providing paper for congress.

	<figcaption>The Veirs ran a significant milling operation on Rock Creek in Montgomery County.</figcaption>
</figure>

As in the Baltimore area, some families were particularly successful in their milling operations. The Veirs family had agricultural mills and a saw mill employing at least fourteen people. The Veirs Bros. even took out an advertisement in the Sentinel, August 22, 1880, promoting Rockville Flouring Mills. There is documentation of the Veirs encouraging the county to propose new roads to their mills, which would serve as a convenience to local farmers (Montgomery County Mill Chapter, 2006).

### Chester County, 1847

Of the eight surveyed counties, Chester County had the second highest number of mills and the earliest survey year. The county at the time was highly agrarian and had ample miles of steep and clean streams for milling. Just west of the city of Philadelphia, Chester County, like Baltimore, shows a high prevalence of factory watermills. These mills were well positioned to transport their products down rivers such as the Schuylkill to market in the Philadelphia ports.

<figure>

</figure>

While factory mills tend to occur on large streams close to the Delaware River, groupings of specifically paper mills can be observed on the upper reaches of some streams. Phipp’s Paper Mill, Mode’s Paper Mill, Babb’s Paper Mill, and New England Paper Mills were all operations found on one short stretch of Buck Run in 1847. These mills would have required clean, clear water for optimal products, and therefore may have been more common on the less turbid headwaters.

Someone by the name of Elisha Phipps posted in the American Republican on February 26, 1823, saying that she was about to alter her paper mill on Buck Run into a cotton factory, which she would then rent for five to seven year terms starting April 1st (Wentz-Eisenstadt, 2009).   The posting described a mill house three stories tall, made of stone, with two vat houses, a stone dam with enough power to turn 2,000 spindles, six houses, a barn, an orchard, and about 100 acres of land consisting of a meadow, plowed field, and timber. In 1847, Phipps is still labeled on the map as the name of a paper mill along Buck Run, but no cotton mill can be found.

</figure>

	In the December 5, 1848 issue of Village Record, New England Paper Mill is listed as being for sale (Wentz-Eisenstadt, 2009). The property is described as 41 acres of land and includes machinery in good order for manufacturing paper at extensive scales. The posting also makes mention of a “good supply of wash water from a spring conveyed in iron pipes into the mill.” This suggests the factory wasn’t relying on Buck Run for the water used in the actual paper production process.

	<figcaption>Ridley Creek in eastern Chester County.</figcaption>
</figure>

An account of Chester County’s Okehocking Historic District provides a description to the relationship between mills and farming in the 19th Century. 
> Ridley Creek and its tributaries meander through the entire District and provided water-power for the mills which operated throughout most of the history of the District to accommodate the needs of the farmers. Hunter's Run rises to the west and flows east while Indian Run, a principal stream, follows Plumsock Road to join Ridley Creek at the southern boundary of the District. Once the settlers moved into the District, milling and farming grew together. The farms spread out along the gentler slopes and valleys in the District and the mills were located along the steeper stretches of Ridley Creek and Indian Run. (The Gombach Group, 2008)
This is the pattern of agriculture in Chester, Lancaster, and York Counties. The mid-Atlantic is known for its fertile soils, but watermills and the local hydrology were instrumental in the region’s ability to produce large quantities of agricultural products.

### Lancaster County, 1864 and 1875

The watermill was common in Lancaster County during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Conestoga River near Lancaster, Pequea Creek in the Southern Portion of the County, Octoraro Creek along the eastern border, and Chiques Crek in the northwest, along with many of these stream’s tributaries, were packed with milldams and watermills.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/mills/lancaster1864-overview.jpg">
	<figcaption>Lancaster County milldam locations in 1864.</figcaption>
</figure>

Spatial patterns of watermills in the county reveal higher prevalence of agricultural mills in the flat and fertile central and northern parts of the county and more prevalent timber operations along the county’s periphery. The Susquehanna River, and the canals and railroads running along it, would have provided valuable transportation for goods produced in the mills up the river’s tributaries. The survey in 1875, eleven years after the 1864 atlas, records less timber related mills, perhaps suggesting fewer mature timber stands.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/mills/lancaster1875-overview.jpg">
	<figcaption>Lancaster County milldam locations in 1875.</figcaption>
</figure>

Today, sediment erosion along many of these streams has significantly detrimental impacts on the ecosystem health of the Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River. Researchers have identified the legacy sediments that accumulated behind milldams as the primary source of these erosional sediments and have begun efforts to restore the stream banks to healthier conditions, ideally similar to the landscape encountered by original European settlers. Marshy, meandering streams and wetlands characterized this sort of landscape with bedrock streambeds in valley bottoms. Watermills and dams by European settlers filled streambeds with sediment and often caused the straightening and repositioning of stream channels to create more space for farm fields and roads (Little Chiques Creek Watershed Rivers Conservation Plan, 2005).

</figure>

Lancaster County is well known for its covered bridges, which were often built to serve watermills. These mills were important commercial nodes, so to provide access to farmers on both sides of the associated creek or river, some sort of bridge and a road would have been required. The Stoneroads Grist Mill was one instance of a bridge and mill. The fieldstone mill was built in 1770 first as a rifle factory, then a gristmill, changing ownership several times until it was closed in the early to mid 1900’s (Stoneroad’s Mill, 2009).

### York County, 1876

The dendritic stream network in York County was similar to the hydrography of Lancaster and Chester Counties and created ample potential for watermills. In the more rugged north and south timber mills abound, while the wider valleys in the middle of the county feature primarily agricultural mills.

### Cumberland County, 1858

The hydrology of Cumberland County is unique because it is defined by two major waterways, The Conodoguinet Creek in the north and the Yellow Breeches Creek in the south. Hills and ridges define the northern and southern boundaries. The central Cumberland Valley is prime land for agriculture, as evidenced by the grist mills on the few streams in this part of the county. The ridges and hills were better suited for timbering, being less arable. Many the more remote locations in the county featured a small saw mill, usually represented as a humble “S.” on the historical atlas.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/mills/cumberland1858-overview.jpg">

</figure>

Mountain Creek, in the south of the county, was unique in that there were six recorded paper mills along the stream in 1858 and mining related operations at its headwaters near Pine Grove Furnace. The first furnace was built in the Pine Grove area was established in 1764. By 1782, Michael Ege, an iron mogul, had purchased the works, which were then inherited by his son Peter. Peter Ege then built Laurel Forge, just down the stream from Pine Grove Furnace, in 1830 (DCNR, 2013).

### Huntingdon County 1873

Beyond the fertile plains of the Piedmont region, timber was the dominant industry in Huntingdon County. On the historical atlases, many of the mills in Huntingdon County are only labeled as saw or grist, not by the name of an operator. This suggests these mills were operated by large enterprises for the specific purpose of processing timber from the surrounding hillsides. The lumber would have then been transported to the Juniata River and rafted downstream.

### Centre County, 1874

Center County, like Huntingdon County, is dominated by saw mills. The area near Bellefonte and Milesburg shows diverse factory milling operations. In the northern backwoods of the county, some splash dams can be found.

The small community of Potter Mills was typical of the villages tucked away among the ridges of this region in many ways. General Potter originally established the village in 1770 and built a grist and saw mill there eight years later. William J. Thompson and his brother, both businessmen, acquired Potter’s original mills in 1861. These mills and the surrounding community would have been the locus of commercial activity in the region, as evidenced by features such as the “W.J. Thompson & Bro Lumber Track” leading out of the mountains and towards the saw mill (Illingworth, 1896).

### Analysis of Hydrologic Patterns

Based on modern hydrologic data, several patterns become clear in the locations of mid 19th century watermills. For the following figures and analyses, the mills data was split by atlas and information about the slope and drainage of each mill’s adjacent stream was considered.

Of all the counties, Center and Huntingdon had the steepest streams adjacent to mills. These counties are both entirely within the ridge and valley province, and mills were often located high along mountain streams among the ridges. York and Cumberland Counties also had slightly steeper streams, both having a somewhat rugged topography.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/mills/slope.png">
	<figcaption>Average slopes of streams for all mill locations in each county.</figcaption>
</figure>

Cumberland County is located at the end of the Cumberland Valley, giving streams like the Conodoguinet a large drainage area. Baltimore County also has several large streams, well suited to providing power for its extensive factory mills. Counties with high average values of stream slope but low drainage areas likely had more intermittent streams than other regions.

<figure>
	<img src="/images/mills/total_drainage.png">
	<figcaption>Total drainage of streams for all mill locations in each county.</figcaption>
</figure>

The two most prevalent watermills were the grist mill, saw mill, and grist-saw mill combination. Plotting stream slope and drainage area for each of these mill types reveals characteristics of the milling industry for each county. In Baltimore County, these types of mills are less common than others and are rarely located on the largest or steepest streams. All counties had saw mills occurring on steeper slopes than gristmills. The raw product for saw mills, timber, is expected to have occurred on hill slopes and mountains, places unsuited to growing the corn ground in gristmills. Lancaster and Chester Counties had by far the most gristmills and combination mills, although Centre and Huntingdon Counties had the most saw mills.

### Conclusion

It is important to note the limitations of the historical atlases dataset. First, the historical atlases may not have included every mill or milldam. It is uncertain if only the largest of mills were included, although it seems likely every effort was made to record all mills and significant landmarks. Second, the milldam location data provides no indication of how large the operation was, besides what can be inferred from the name of the facility and its proximity to market and hydrography. County borders have an edge affect making it impossible to know from these atlases what mills or towns were a few steps across the border. It is also clear that by the mid-19th century, most mills were not under the original ownership, but usually had been inherited, bankrupted, or sold with the typical result being the facility transferring to a larger business or wealthier owner.

However, the thousands of milldams included in this analysis and the specific histories of these locations make several patterns clear. Factories were located close to market and paper mills were located close to clean water. Agricultural mills dominated the rural valley landscape and timber mills were prevalent especially along mountain streams. Mining operations occurred in clusters close to the resource and were usually under control of a single operation. Mills were the economic center of the rural landscape and when these mills were successful, rural communities would develop around them. The specific histories of these mills also reveal that milling required investment in capital that few could afford, but those who found success would be able to expand their operations and add to their estate.

The watermill shaped the physical, economic, and cultural landscape in the Mid-Atlantic perhaps more than any other structure at this time. It encouraged the building of roads, bridges, and communities. It allowed people to process raw material into valuable products faster than any other means until the advent of fossil fuels. It served as the economic driver behind communities and estates that have had lasting impacts of, at the least, leave their names on the landscape today. And it altered the physical landscape through the straightening of stream channels and deposition of many feet of sediment across valley bottoms. This too easily forgotten landmark of a pre-industrial area was at the heart of history’s landscapes and leaves a lasting legacy.

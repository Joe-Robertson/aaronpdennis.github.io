The stream network of the Mid-Atlantic region saw the creation of thousands of watermills from the period of initial European settlement to as late as the early 20th century. These mills were used most commonly for grinding grain, as well as other mechanical processes such as sawing timber into lumber, hammering at iron forges, or manufacturing goods including paper and cotton. A watermill relied on a milldam and millrace to provide the hydrologic potential energy to turn a waterwheel. Processing ore, grain, or timber at the mill automated the otherwise difficult process of manually grinding or sawing and it allowed for the easier transport of goods to market. The prevalence and utility of watermills from the 1600’s to the early 1900’s suggests their importance to historic communities. The intent of this paper is to determine how the location and qualities of these watermills reflected and changed the region’s rural landscape at the time and explore the lasting impact of these mills on our modern landscape.

### The Data

Inspiration for this work is derived from a dataset collected by the Historic Sediment and Geomorphology Research Group at Franklin & Marshall College. In this dataset, milldam locations from historical atlases for eight counties in Pennsylvania and Maryland were carefully digitized, and information on year surveyed, watermill type, and watermill name, if available, was recorded.

### Baltimore County and Baltimore City, 1857 and 1863

Baltimore was particularly well suited to milling operations (Chidester, 2009). Once focused on flour milling operations, textiles became one of Maryland's most important industries by the mid 19th century. In Baltimore, Jones Falls, Gwynn Falls, Gunpowder Falls, and Patapsco River were important sources of waterpower. Specific products of Baltimore's textile industries included cloth sails for the clipper ships in Baltimore's harbor. Textiles made Maryland the largest manufacturing state in the south and contributed to a fast growing economy.

Whereas in other regions milling operations were largely carried out by individuals or small families who had some success in farming or previous experience as millers, Baltimore milling was characterized by large estates or companies owning and overseeing multiple milling operations. Instead of small facilities transfering from one landholding individual to another, Baltimore's factory mills large-scale industrial projects sensitive to market influences and transferred between large companies that usually had stake in multiple operations.

The Ellicott family was an example of an estate with large industrial holdings. This family rose to prominence with early success in Maryland's merchant flour industry (Sharp, 1998). Success in the flour industry allowed the Ellicotts to move into industrial operations such as nail manufacture and metalworking. Financial panic in 1837 led to the Ellicotts losing much of their holdings, including their rolling mill facility, which was acquired by a group of investors. Metalworks such as the rolling mill facility were transitioned into textile facilities and other industrial operations in the later 19th century as baltimore's industries diversified.

A look at other mills from Baltimore's historic atlases reveals milling operations with labels such as "Maryland Machine Manufactory Company" and "F.W. Hook & Co. Cotton & Yarn Fact." reveal the industrial nature of the operations. Other milling operations were also large scale, but were run by a single family. Samuel Owings II built his first mill in 1770 and his family would continue milling operations until approximately 1850. The Owings property included a main house, a tenant house, and a two story slave house (McGrain, 1987).

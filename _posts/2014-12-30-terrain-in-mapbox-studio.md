Mapbox Studio provides access to vector hillshades for styling maps with terrain. The most recent global vector terrain dataset, Version 2, uses incredibly high resolution elevation data and is designed to provide "twice as much shadow detail and is based on a combined hill-shading and slope-shading technique that allows for better emphasis in areas of steep terrain." This looks great on the big mountains, but it comes at the small sacrifice of detail on softer landscapes. In the images below, Version 1 reveals rolling hills in the valleys while Version 2 provides sharp detail along the ridges.

This isn't my first "ePortfolio". Penn State encourages all its students to set up a site dedicated to themselves and I did that last winter with a WordPress.com service offered by the university. In the spring, I moved to a Weebly.com site which was better suited to an online portfolio and had templates more to my taste. I've learned a lot about the internet and web development and coding since then and right now I'm pretty excited about this GitHub Pages hosted, Jekyll powered website. I now feel I'm ready to start establishing a meaningful web presence and get to work customizing this site, built on the awesome theme, Minimal Mistakes.
